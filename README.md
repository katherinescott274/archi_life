# archi_life
This is my first html website, in order to show my work from my architectural studies, 

to be accessed by prospective employers and those who follow my work on instagram. 

It will supercede a wix.com hosted website I have used.

I want it to be simple, clean and basic, showing elegantly my work and how to contact me.

I will eventually add blog posts and hopefully a scrolling bar of work - but for now this is how it stands!

Happy viewing!
